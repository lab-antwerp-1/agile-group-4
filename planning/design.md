# Wireframes

## Overview

We will make a website about car renting and selling (buying) company. It will consist of 5 html pages in total.
In each page, there will be header (banner+title), navigation bar and footer links. 
Contact nav link will direct user to footer links. 
Footer links will provide Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Gmail links and also address/tel info. 
This is first draft. With proposals it will be improved. Edit: 'Buy' page will be cancelled instead there will be 
separate 'ContactUs' page. 'Buy' nav link will be deleted also. Our company will be only a rent a car firm. 
Wireframes will be adjusted accordingly later on. You can design your MAiN part in your chosen page according to 
your wish. These wireframes are just to give idea.
